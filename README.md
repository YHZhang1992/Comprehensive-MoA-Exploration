# Comprehensive-MoA-Exploration
Including model characterization, MoA exploration and mouse-human translation
1. Model characterization: at gene, pathway and network level evaluating mouse modeling
2. MoA exploration: monitor DGE, pathway and network changes in mouse model after ASO/siRNA treatment
3. Mouse-human translation: org.Hs.eg.db, org.Mm.eg.db and homologene package
